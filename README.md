###Plan Overview
We need a plan to introduce employees to the concepts and  functionality of [tibbr](https://tibbr.fan.gov), the enterprise social media tool being used for a collaboration proof of concept for the Foreign Affairs Network. We can develop this plan over the next several weeks as we gain experience with tibbr, learn more about how it functions, and determine what the main stumbling blocks will be for employees to become effective and efficient tibbr users.
